# Definition
Entropy is a computer science concept that measures the degree of randomness in a system, so a high entropy means that the data inside is really random and disorder, which means that the author possibly has obfuscated some part of the executable. </br>

# Example
Sample: strings.exe </br>
As below, this information of sample ```strings.exe``` get from pestudio tool. </br>
```

Can see value ```entropy: 6.445``` not high means that the data inside not random and not disorder. This means data inside not pack by packer tools </br>

Another samples, using packer tools UPX to packed this sample ```strings.exe``` and using tool pestudio to get information. </br>
As below, this information of sample after packed by UPX </br>
